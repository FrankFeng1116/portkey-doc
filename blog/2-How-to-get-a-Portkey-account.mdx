You can sign up in Portkey using your social info: phone number, email address, Google account, and Apple ID. It follows these steps:

1. Choose the type of info you want to use for account creation and enter it.
   * During this step, Portkey will randomly assign you a decentralised verifier to your sign-up account. If you want to know what a verifier is, please read <u>this</u>.
2. Your sign-up account will then receive a verification code and you need to enter it in Portkey.
3. Then you can set a PIN/enable biometric authentication, like face ID and touch ID, for your device.
   * A PIN is like a password that's only valid on this device. If you log in on other devices later, you need to set a separate PIN for that device.
4. Your account has just been created.
   Upon account creation, the info you use to register is set as your first <u>guardian</u> as well as the <u>login account</u>. To strengthen account security, Portkey encourages you to add more guardians before you start managing your assets or using any DApps.
