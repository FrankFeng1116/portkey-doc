All your transactions, including token/NFT transfers and social recovery activities, are recorded on blockchain. Just click "Activity" on the Portkey home screen and you can see all the records.
You can choose any record and check its details, including the date, transaction ID, and fee. For some transactions, you may find that the fee is zero, and you can read this to learn the possible reasons. You can also click "View on Explorer" at the bottom, which will direct you to the transaction details page on aelf explorer, to see other data like block info and logs.
