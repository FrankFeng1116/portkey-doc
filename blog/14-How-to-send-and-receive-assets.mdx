With Portkey, you can conveniently send and receive digital assets to and from other users, your other accounts, and addresses on different chains.
**To send:**

1. Click the "Send" button on the home screen.
2. Select the token you want to send.
   * Since some tokens are available on multiple chains, like aelf's MainChain and SideChains, please make sure you choose the right token on the right chain.
3. On the transfer page, you can copy and paste the recipient's address into the "To" field. If you're operating via a mobile device, you can also click the top right-hand corner to scan the recipient's QR code.
4. Then click "Next", enter the amount you want to send, and click "Preview".
5. Before you complete the transaction, please double-check that the recipient's address and amount to be sent are correct. Once you click "Send", the transaction will be initiated on the blockchain and it's irreversible.
   **To receive:**
6. Click the "Receive" button on the home screen.
7. Select the token you want to receive.
   * Since some tokens are available on multiple chains, like aelf's MainChain and SideChains, please make sure you choose the right token on the right chain.
8. On the receive page, you will be presented with the QR code and wallet address of your account. You can either show the QR code to the sender and let them scan it (scanning can be done on mobile devices only), or you can share the address with the sender.
9. The sender can then follow the instructions above to send the tokens to you.
