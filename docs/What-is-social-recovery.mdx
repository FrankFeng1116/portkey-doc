title: What is social recovery?
---

Social recovery in Portkey allows users to regain access to their accounts by obtaining approvals from their designated guardians. This process consists of two parts:

1. Users initiate social recovery, and Portkey sends verification codes to selected guardians. Users must then obtain these codes from their [guardians](/docs/What-are-guardians-and-verifiers "") and enter them in Portkey for verification. The verification is carried out by verifiers, i.e. decentralised external service providers.
2. Once the approvals from guardians meet predefined criteria (specific requirements vary, as explained below), the social recovery process is successfully completed.
   * If the total number of guardians is 3 or fewer, users need approval from all of the guardians.
   * If there are more than 3 guardians, users need approval from 3/5 (rounded down) + 1 of them.
