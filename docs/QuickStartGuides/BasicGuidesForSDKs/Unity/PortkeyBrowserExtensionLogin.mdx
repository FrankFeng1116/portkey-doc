# Authenticate using Portkey Browser Extension

You can let your users authenticate with Portkey using their Portkey Browser Extension by using the Portkey SDK for sign-in flow. All signing of transactions will be done through the Portkey Browser Extension.

This is only available on WebGL.

## Access the PortkeySDK.AuthService

The AuthService class is the entry point for all authentication API calls. It is accessable through PortkeySDK.AuthService.

```c#
IAuthService auth = PortkeySDK.AuthService;
```

## Authenticate with PortkeySDK

1. Log in the user directly through AuthService using LoginWithPortkeyExtension.

```c#
// mySuccessCallback will be called when the user successfully authenticated with Portkey Browser Extension.
StartCoroutine(PortkeySDK.AuthService.LoginWithPortkeyExtension(mySuccessCallback));
```

## Next Steps

After the user has signed up or logged in, a DIDAccountInfo will be returned that corresponds to the account within Portkey Browser Extension used to login. DIDAccountInfo contains signing key and account information that can be used to get a user's account balance and sign transactions.

## Sign out

To sign out a user, call Logout or disconnect from the Portkey Browser Extension.
```c#
StartCoroutine(PortkeySDK.AuthService.Logout());
```
