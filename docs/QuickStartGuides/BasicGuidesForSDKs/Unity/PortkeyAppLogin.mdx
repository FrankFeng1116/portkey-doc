# Authenticate using Portkey Mobile App

You can let your users authenticate with Portkey using their Portkey Mobile App by using the Portkey SDK for sign-in flow.

This is only available on iOS and Android.

## Access the PortkeySDK.AuthService

The `AuthService` class is the entry point for all authentication API calls. It is accessible through `PortkeySDK.AuthService`.

```c#
IAuthService auth = PortkeySDK.AuthService;
```

## Authenticate with PortkeySDK

1. Log in the user directly through `AuthService` using `LoginWithPortkeyApp`.

```c#
// mySuccessCallback will be called when the user successfully authenticated with Portkey Browser Extension.
StartCoroutine(PortkeySDK.AuthService.LoginWithPortkeyApp(mySuccessCallback));
```

2. You may choose to cancel the Portkey App Login anytime by calling `CancelLoginWithPortkeyApp` from `AuthMessage`.
```c#
// this will cancel the login flow for logging in with Portkey App when it is still authenticating the user.
PortkeySDK.AuthService.Message.CancelLoginWithPortkeyApp();
```

## Next Steps

After the user has signed up or logged in, a `DIDAccountInfo` will be returned that corresponds to the account within Portkey App used to login. `DIDAccountInfo` contains signing key and account information that can be used to get a user's account balance and sign transactions.

## Sign out

To sign out a user, call `Logout`.
```c#
StartCoroutine(PortkeySDK.AuthService.Logout());
```
