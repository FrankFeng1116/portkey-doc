title: How to access DApps?
---

For Portkey App users, all the DApps/projects that Portkey supports are presented in the "Discover" section. After clicking on the DApp you want to interact with, you can log in using your current Portkey account with one click.

For Portkey extension users, you can access the DApps/projects supported through their individual websites and connect your Portkey account via the login button or button serving the same functionality on the site.
