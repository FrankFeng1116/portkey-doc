title: What are the DApps/projects I can use in Portkey?
---

Portkey offers users access to the aelf explorer, a key entry point for various activities on the aelf network. Portkey App users can seamlessly connect their accounts to the explorer via the "Discover" section, participating in governance voting, resource token trading, and smart contract deployment/updates. Portkey extension users can access the aelf explorer via the [website](https://explorer.aelf.io/ "").

In addition to the explorer, Portkey supports gaming projects like BeanGo Town, a Web3 game using aelf's Verifiable Random Function (VRF) for random number generation.

Looking ahead, Portkey plans to introduce more diverse DApps, including but not limited to GamFi, NFT marketplaces, DeFi, Metaverse, and more.
