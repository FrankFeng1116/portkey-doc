title: How to start a group chat?
---

Portkey group chat allows users to create/join a group and chat with multiple users at the same time.
Alternatively, you can also start a [private chat](/docs/How-to-start-a-private-chat "") with just one fellow user.

**Create a group:**

1. On the Portkey home screen, click "Chat" (mobile phone users) / the chat icon (extension users).
2. Click the + button at the top right corner of the interface and then select "Create Group."
3. Enter a name for the group and select the contacts you'd like to invite. Then click “Done” to create the group.

**Invite others to join:**

1. Visit the group to which you'd like to invite users, click the ... button at the top right corner of the interface and then select "Group Info."
2. To add an existing contact to this group, you can click "Add Members" in the group info interface and select the contacts you want to invite.
3. To invite someone who is not your contact yet, you can click the copy icon or QR code icon under the "Invite Link." Then you can send or share the link/code to the people you want to invite.
