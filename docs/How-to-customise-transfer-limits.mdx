title: How to customise transfer limits?
---

The transfer limits feature allows users to set a cap for the amount of tokens that can be transferred out of their accounts. There are two types of limits: daily limit and limit per transaction. The limits take effect when the user initiates a transfer to others or when they sell cryptos for fiat currencies. Once the limits are customised, transactions exceeding the stipulated amount cannot be completed unless the user manually modifies the figures first.

**Set transfer limits:**

1. On the Portkey home screen, click "My" (mobile phone users) / the avatar in the top right-hand corner (extension users).
2. Click "Wallet Security" > "Payment Security" and select the token for which you want to customise the settings. Click "Edit."
3. Enter the limit amouts for a single transaction and daily transactions respectively. Click "Send Request" to obtain approval from guardians.
4. On the next page, you will see the list of your existing guardians. Click "Send" to send a verification code to the selected guardian.
   * Depending on the number of guardians you have, the requirements for approval differ as stipulated [here](/docs/What-is-social-recovery "").
5. Repeat the above process until enough codes have been obtained and verified. Then you can click "Confirm" to complete the setting.
