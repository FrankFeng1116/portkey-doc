title: How does Portkey's payment delegation mechanism work?
---

Portkey employs a unique payment delegation mechanism to ease users' burden and cover the costs associated with AA wallets creation and usage for them. This mechanism enables third parties to serve as delegatees, paying transaction fees on behalf of users and facilitating their cost-free entry into the world of Web3.

The following are the three payment delegation types currently utilised in Portkey:

|Type|Requirements|Types of transactions included|
|:------|:------|:------|
|Type one|Delegatees will cover the transaction fees regardless of users' balances.|Account creation, login, and login by scanning QR code.|
|Type two|Delegatees only need to cover the transaction fees when the users don't have enough balance.|Adding/removing guardians, and changing login accounts.
|Type three|Delegatees will never cover the transaction fees.|Token transfers, cross-chain transactions, NFT creation, etc.|
