title: How to send or claim crypto gifts?
---

Crypto gift is a unique feature in Portkey, allowing users to send and receive cryptocurrencies as gifts. Shareable via links, gifts can be customised with criteria for claiming them.

### To send crypto gifts:

1. Click your account name in the top right corner of the home screen, then tap "Crypto Gift" > "Create Crypto Gift".
2. Choose between sending crypto gifts with a "Random" or "Fixed" amount:
   * Fixed Amount: The cryptocurrency you provide will be evenly distributed among all recipients, ensuring everyone gets an identical share.
   * Random Amount: This adds an element of surprise! For example, a gift of 100 ELF claimed by two individuals could result in one claiming 99 ELF and the other claiming 1 ELF, making it a fun game of chance.
3. Select the cryptocurrency you want to send (including tokens, NFTs, or inscriptions) from the dropdown menu and enter the desired amount.
4. Set specific limits for claimers, such as restricting claims to newly registered Portkey users only.
5. Click "Preview" to check the transaction details, and then click "Confirm" if everything is correct.
6. Once the crypto gift is created, a link will be generated for you to share. Anyone who opens the link and meets your criteria can claim it before it is fully claimed or expires. As the gift sender, you can easily track the status of your gift on the crypto gift page.

### To receive crypto gifts:

1. Click a crypto gift link to be redirected to the gift's site, then tap "Claim Crypto Gift" to check its claiming status.
   * As long as it is not fully claimed and hasn't expired, you will be allocated a share of the gift.
2. Tap "Sign up to Receive" and log in or sign up. If your account meets the claim criteria, you'll receive cryptocurrency directly in your Portkey wallet.
   * Remember, each gift is valid for 20 minutes upon opening, so act quickly to receive it before it expires!

> If you see a message stating, "Unclaimed gifts may be up for grabs! Try to claim once the countdown ends", it means there are currently no gifts available. However, you may still have a chance to claim the gift if others fail to "Sign up to Receive" before it expires. Just wait for the countdown to reach zero and try your luck again!
