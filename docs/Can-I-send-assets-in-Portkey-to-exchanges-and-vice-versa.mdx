Transactions between Portkey accounts and exchanges are possible, as long as the exchange has integrated with the aelf blockchain and can monitor VA-based wallet transactions.

Currently, top-tier exchanges like Binance, Bithumb, OKX, and gate.io have supported this. The Portkey team is actively working to establish connections with additional exchanges to broaden the coverage.
