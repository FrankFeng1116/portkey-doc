title: What are the main advantages of Portkey?
---

As a cutting-edge AA wallet that seamlessly facilitates the transition from Web2 to Web3, Portkey offers a competitive edge in the following areas:

* **Low Cost**: Account creation is cost-free for all users, and transaction fees are negligible, as low as 0.003 ELF.
* **Ease of Use**: Users can use their Web2 social info to create accounts without the need to memorise private keys or seed phrases.
* **Security**: User assets are safeguarded through the [social recovery](/docs/What-is-social-recovery "") mechanism, overseen by their trusted guardians and verifiers.
* **Decentralisation**: External service providers function as [verifiers](/docs/What-are-guardians-and-verifiers "") to boost the level of decentralisation in the social recovery process.
* **Developer-Friendliness**: Portkey provides comprehensive toolsets and plug-and-play SDKs to developers, enabling them to quickly launch Web3 projects and enhance DApps for users to enjoy.
