title: How to claim Testnet tokens?
---

Testnet ELF tokens can be claimed for free in the Testnet mode, so please [switch to Testnet](/docs/How-to-switch-networks "") first if you want to receive test tokens.
Due to the difference in design, App users' and extension users' token-claiming experiences are not the same.

**App users:**

1. Click the "Faucet" button on the home screen. You can receive 100 ELF test tokens, refreshed every 24 hours.

**Extension users:**

1. Click the "Faucet" button on the home screen and you will be directed to a faucet site.
2. Enter your wallet address there to manually claim 1,000 Testnet ELF tokens.
   * Each address is eligible for one claim only. If you don't know how to obtain your wallet address, please visit [send and receive assets](/docs/How-to-send-and-receive-assets "").
