title: Why do some of my transaction records show the transaction fee is zero?
---

Your transaction records in Portkey can be accessed via the "Activity" section on the home screen. Some transactions may display a transaction fee of zero, which can be attributed to two reasons:

1. Portkey utilises a unique payment delegation mechanism to cover specific types of transaction fees, such as account creation and login. You can find more details about this mechanism and its delegation conditions <u>here</u>.
2. The aelf blockchain has a transaction fee exemption mechanism that allows users holding more than 10 ELF to be exempt from 1 ELF worth of transaction fees each day.
   If your account or the transaction involved meets either of these conditions, the fee incurred will be delegated/exempted so that you don't need to pay a penny.
