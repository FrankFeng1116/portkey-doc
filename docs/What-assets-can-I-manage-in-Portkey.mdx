title: What assets can I manage in Portkey?
---

You can manage assets on the [aelf](/docs/What-is-aelf "") blockchain, including the ELF token, numerous NFTs, and various resource tokens on both the MainChain and SideChains.

As the aelf ecosystem grows, more tokens and NFTs will be created, enhancing the Web3 experience for Portkey users. Additionally, with the anticipated launch of a cross-chain bridge on aelf, tokens from chains like Ethereum and BSC can be transferred to aelf, further expanding the range of assets that Portkey users can manage.
