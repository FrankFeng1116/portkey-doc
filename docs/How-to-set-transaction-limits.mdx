title: How to set transaction limits?
---

Transaction limits allow you to set caps on the amount of tokens that can be transferred from your account. There are two types of limits: daily limit and limit per transaction.

* Daily limit: The maximum amount you can transfer in a 24-hour period.
* Limit per transaction: The maximum amount you can transfer in a single transaction.

These limits will apply when you initiate a transfer or sell cryptocurrencies for fiat currencies. If a transaction exceeds the set limit, it will not be completed unless you manually adjust the limits.
