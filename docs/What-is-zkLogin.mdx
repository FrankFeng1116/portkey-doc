title: What is zkLogin?
---

Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are a cryptographic technique that allows one party (the prover) to prove the truth of a statement to another party (the verifier) without revealing any additional information. This ensures unmatched privacy and security. Integrated into Portkey, ZKPs enable zkLogin, allowing users to sign up and log in without relying on external verifiers, creating a safer and more trustworthy digital environment.

In Portkey, your account is protected by a [social recovery mechanism](/docs/What-is-social-recovery ""), where guardians (like your email, Google account, Apple ID, or Telegram) and a verifier (typically a third-party provider) work together to confirm your identity. With zkLogin, your data can be validated directly without the need for a third-party verifier, enhancing security and privacy. If you use Google or Apple as your guardian, zkLogin is automatically selected as the verifier.

zkLogin offers unparalleled levels of provable, tamper-proof identity verification. With this technology, Portkey enables users to securely prove their eligibility and comply with service providers' requirements, all without exposing sensitive personal data. By ensuring that digital identities are both distinct and verifiable, Portkey's integration of ZKPs aims to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3 applications, promoting a more secure, privacy-centric, and user-focused internet.
