title: How to mint NFTs for free?
---

Portkey offers a "free mint NFT" function, allowing users—whether Web3 veterans or newcomers—to create their own digital collectibles easily at no cost. The minting process is streamlined into three simple steps: upload an image, choose a name, and start minting. This feature encourages creativity and enables users to explore the world of digital assets freely.

All free mint NFTs will be part of the [PortBadge collection](https://www.eforest.finance/explore-items/tDVV-PORTBADGE-0 ""), featuring a distinctive shiny symbol labelled PORTBADGE.

**Here's how to mint your NFT:**
