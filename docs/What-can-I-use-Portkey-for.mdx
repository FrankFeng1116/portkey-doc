Currently, Portkey offers support for various Web3 features, including account creation, crypto-fiat on/off-ramps, digital asset management, DApp interactions, instant chats, and more, as outlined below:

* **Web3 Account Creation**: Portkey welcomes users to create Web3 accounts, i.e. on-chain wallet addresses, which are resistant to censorship and centralised control. These accounts exist on the aelf blockchain, granting users access to services within the aelf ecosystem.
* **Crypto-Fiat On/Off-Ramps**: Users can effortlessly purchase cryptocurrencies using their credit cards or payment services like Apple Pay, eliminating the need to rely on centralised exchanges for their cryptocurrency acquisition. Selling cryptocurrencies is equally straightforward with just a few clicks. Portkey ensures compliance with relevant regulations, enabling secure and seamless conversions between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.
* **Digital Asset Management**: Portkey account holders have the capability to send, receive, and manage tokens and NFTs. Peer-to-peer transactions are executed instantly and recorded on the blockchain for easy tracking of transaction data.
* **Interactions with DApps**: Portkey encourages developers to build DApps and migrate to Web3 by providing the handiest SDK tools. This creates a developer-friendly environment where DApps, particularly gaming projects, will flourish. In the end, users can access a wide array of DApps and enjoy an enhanced Web3 experience.
* **Instant Chats**: Portkey facilitates user interaction by enabling them to discover and add fellow users as contacts, fostering one-to-one or group conversations where thoughts and ideas can be freely exchanged.
