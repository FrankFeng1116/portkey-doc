You can view and manage all the devices where your Portkey account is logged in, and remove any devices you no longer need.

1. On the Portkey home screen, click your account name, then select "Manage devices" from the dropdown list. Here, you'll see a list of all devices where your account is logged in.
2. Tap the edit button in the top-right corner and select the device you want to remove.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete guardian approval and confirm to remove the device.

* If you wish to log in again to your Portkey wallet on that device, you will need guardian approval.
