title: What is security detection?
---

Portkey implements security detection to ensure user accounts are safeguarded to the highest standard and to increase user awareness around account security. If a user's account holds a significant amount of tokens but only has a single guardian, Portkey will notify the user to add more guardians for enhanced protection.

This feature is designed to raise the security level of user accounts by prompting users to take proactive measures and add additional layers of protection. Having only one guardian can create a single point of failure. If access to the sole guardian is lost, users will be unable to manage their Portkey account, as they won't be able to complete login or transaction approvals that require guardian verification. This can result in being locked out of their account.

With security detection, users are alerted when additional guardians are needed, ensuring their Portkey experience is not disrupted by unexpected issues or failures. For a detailed guide, check out the step-by-step [tutorial for adding guardians](/docs/How-to-add-or-remove-guardians "").

Note: When adding new guardians, it's recommended to use different guardian types. Portkey supports four types of guardians: email address, Google account, Apple ID, and Telegram account. Using a variety of guardian types reduces the risk of losing access due to issues arising from a single service provider.
