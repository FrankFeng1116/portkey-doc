title: What is a login account?
---

A <u>login account</u> is a special guardian linked to your Portkey account. Just like regular guardians, a login account is responsible for safeguarding your account and assets. However, it is distinct in that it represents your identity. To log in to Portkey, you must provide the correct login account to indicate which account you are accessing.

A Portkey wallet can have multiple login accounts, but each login account can only identify one Portkey account. This means different Portkey wallets can not use the same guardian as their login account. Since a login account represents identity and is used for wallet access, users are advised to designate their own social information as their login accounts.
